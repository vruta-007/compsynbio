X-gal is cleaved by beta-galactosidase to produce a substituted indole compound, which dimerizes to produce a blue colour (used in blue-white colony screening). To overproduce X-gal in E. coli, we need a strain in which the beta-galactosidase has been mutated for loss of function OR deleted.  Thankfully, such a strain already exists!
